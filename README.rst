MyJeta
======

MyJeta is a web application which predicts the expected journey time of a Dublin Bus passanger. It uses historic Dublin Bus and weather data to create dynamic travel time estimates. When presented with any bus route, departure time, day of the week and current weather conditions, the application produces an accurate estimate of journey travel time. Realtime bus arrival data is integrated into the the application to provide the user with an estimated time of arrival given the time at which the next bus arrives. The application also provides users with station specific timetable information, bus fare information for their chosen journey, and a news stream containing Dublin Bus related information. To facilitate the selection of a route, MyJeta plots potential destinations on a map for the user to select from, given their starting stop. The application user interface is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
